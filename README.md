# A Multi-Modal Convolutional Neural Network Strategy for Spoof Detection

The method introduced aims to tackle the face anti-spoofing problem by leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach while utilizing the WMCA dataset. This method utilizes a combination of color (C), depth (D), infrared (IR), and thermal (T) modalities to enhance the performance of the neural network model.

## The method of the proposed

The proposed method comprises two scenarios:

1. Pre-Fusion Scenario:
In this scenario, a series of experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the system. Various combinations of multi-modal data are tested, and all modalities are swapped with each other to ensure comprehensive and realistic results.

</div>


2. Post-Fusion Scenario:
In this scenario, individual modalities are processed independently. Each modality undergoes a separate anti-spoofing algorithm, producing individual outputs. These outputs are then combined using different fusion methods, which include:
* Majority Voting.
* Weighted Voting.
* Averaging/Pooling.
* Stacking/Stacked Generalization.
